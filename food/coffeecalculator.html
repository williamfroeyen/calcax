                   A traditional coffee cup usually holds 1.5 dl of water, and a tea cup typically holds 2.0 - 5.0 dl of water. A level scoop holds 10 grams of coffee. The general recommendation is 6 grams of coffee powder per deciliter of water. Some may prefer stronger or weaker coffee than this.

                    The taste of coffee can vary greatly depending on the type of bean, roasting level, and brewing method. Arabica and Robusta are the two most common coffee beans, with Arabica often offering a more aromatic and acidic taste, while Robusta has a stronger, more bitter character. The roasting level also plays an important role. Light-roasted coffee often has fruity and floral notes, whereas dark-roasted coffee tends to have flavors of chocolate and nuts.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The brewing method also significantly affects the flavor. Filter coffee provides a clean and balanced cup, while espresso-based coffee often has a more intense and full-bodied character. French press coffee offers a rounder taste with more oils from the beans, whereas boiled coffee can have a more rustic and earthy character. Many have their preferred method and believe it to be the best, but ultimately, it is a matter of taste and habit.

                    For many, drinking coffee is more than just a caffeine boost. It is a habit, a routine, a small ritual in everyday life. Some start the day with a cup of black coffee, while others prefer a cappuccino or a latte with milk. Some believe coffee tastes best when enjoyed alone in peace and quiet, while others value it most in good company. Coffee breaks have for generations been a social gathering point, whether at work, at the breakfast table at home, or at a café.

                    The history of coffee is also fascinating. It is said to have originated in Ethiopia, where a shepherd discovered coffee beans after noticing that his goats became more energetic after eating the red berries from a particular bush. From there, coffee spread to the Arab world, where it became a central part of the culture. Later, it was introduced to Europe, where it quickly gained popularity. Today, coffee is grown in many countries, mainly in tropical regions, and has become one of the world's most sought-after commodities.
