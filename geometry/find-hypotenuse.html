                    The legs are the two shortest sides of a right-angled triangle. The hypotenuse is the longest side and is always opposite the right angle. The unit of the hypotenuse is the same as the sides of the triangle, and its length can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. This mathematical rule states that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides, called the legs, is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This is expressed by the formula: c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), where a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The Pythagorean theorem applies only to triangles where one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees. To find the length of the hypotenuse, start by squaring the lengths of the two legs. Then, sum these squares, and finally, take the square root of the sum to find the hypotenuse itself. This principle makes it possible to calculate the unknown side if the lengths of the other two are known.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    This mathematical rule has been known for thousands of years and is attributed to the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, although evidence suggests it was known in other cultures long before his time. Today, it is used in various practical applications, including construction, navigation, and mapping. It simplifies distance and height calculations without requiring direct measurement.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    An example of using the Pythagorean theorem could be a ladder leaning against a wall. If you know the height from the ground to the top of the ladder and the distance from the wall to the ladder's base, you can calculate the ladder's length. This is just one of many ways the theorem simplifies everyday calculations.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Although the Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental part of mathematics, mistakes can be made if the legs and the hypotenuse are confused. The hypotenuse is always the longest side, and this must be considered when setting up the calculation. Errors can also occur if the square root is forgotten at the end of the calculation, leading to an entirely different answer.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In many cases, the theorem is also used to find the length of an unknown leg if the hypotenuse and one leg are known. This is done by isolating the unknown side in the formula, subtracting the square of the known leg from the square of the hypotenuse, and then taking the square root.
