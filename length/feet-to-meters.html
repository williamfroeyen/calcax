                    To convert feet to meters (ft to m), multiply the number of feet by 0.3048. Therefore, 1 foot equals 0.3048 meters. The meter is one of the most fundamental and widely used units of length in the metric system. It is defined as the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. The symbol for meter is "m".

                    In scientific and technical contexts, the meter is crucial for specifying precise measurements. In physics, the meter is used to describe the wavelength of light, sound, and other phenomena. In engineering, the meter is used to design and construct buildings, bridges, and other structures. In sports, the meter is used to measure the length of running tracks, swimming pools, and other competition arenas.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The meter is also part of compound units used to express other physical quantities. For example, the square meter (m²) is a unit of area, and the cubic meter (m³) is a unit of volume. These units are important in fields such as construction, land surveying, and commerce.
                    The metric system, of which the meter is a part, is a decimal-based system. This means that units are related to each other through powers of 10. For example, a kilometer (km) is equal to 1000 meters, a centimeter (cm) is equal to 0.01 meters, and a millimeter (mm) is equal to 0.001 meters. This makes it easy to convert between different units within the metric system.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Historically, the definition of the meter has evolved over time. Originally, the meter was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a meridian passing through Paris. Later, the meter was defined as the length of a specific object made of a platinum-iridium alloy. The current definition, based on the speed of light, was adopted in 1983.
