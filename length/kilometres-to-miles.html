                    The formula to convert kilometers to miles is: Miles = kilometers * 0.62137. The mile, commonly referred to as "mile" in English-speaking countries, is a unit of length used primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, and a few other nations. One mile is exactly 1,609.344 meters or approximately 1.61 kilometers, making it significantly longer than the Scandinavian mil, which equals 10 kilometers.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The origin of the mile dates back to ancient Rome, where a measurement called "mille passus" (meaning "a thousand paces") was used. This equaled roughly 1,480 meters. In medieval England, the length of the mile was gradually standardized, and under Queen Elizabeth I in 1593, it was officially defined as 5,280 feet or 1,760 yards.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Today, the mile remains widely used in the United States and the United Kingdom, particularly for road signs, speed limits, and sports. For example, marathons are often measured in miles in English-speaking countries, and vehicle fuel efficiency in the U.S. is expressed in miles per gallon (MPG).
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In most other countries, the metric system has replaced miles with kilometers, including in Scandinavia. However, miles are still encountered in international contexts, particularly in sports, aviation, and maritime navigation. In aviation, for example, the nautical mile is used, which is a distinct unit equal to 1,852 meters.
