                    To convert from Celsius to Kelvin, add 273.15 to the Celsius degrees to get the number of degrees in Kelvin. The formula is: °K = °C + 273.15. Kelvin (K) is a unit of temperature in the international SI system. The unit is named after the British physicist William Thomson, better known as Lord Kelvin, who played a central role in the development of thermodynamics. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale, meaning it starts at absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature where all atomic motion stops. This point corresponds to 0 K, which is equal to −273.15 degrees Celsius.

                    Unlike Celsius and Fahrenheit, which are based on the freezing and boiling points of water, the Kelvin scale is directly related to the fundamental properties of matter. A change of one degree in Kelvin is exactly the same as a change of one degree Celsius, but the Kelvin scale does not have negative values. This makes it particularly useful in scientific contexts, where accurate and consistent measurements are crucial.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Kelvin is mainly used in physics, chemistry, and astronomy. For example, temperatures in space are often given in Kelvin because it provides a more precise measurement. In the laws of thermodynamics, the use of Kelvin is essential, as many formulas, such as the ideal gas law, require the use of absolute temperature to give correct results.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The definition of Kelvin has evolved over time. Previously, it was defined based on the triple point of water, which is the temperature at which water simultaneously exists as a solid, liquid, and gas. In 2019, the definition was adjusted so that Kelvin is now based on the fundamental Boltzmann constant, providing an even more precise and universal definition.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The significance of the Kelvin scale extends far beyond the laboratory. In meteorology, it is used to measure radiation temperatures, and in engineering, it is important for calculations related to the thermal properties of materials. Also in everyday life, Kelvin appears, for example, in the description of the color temperature of light, where higher Kelvin values indicate colder, blue light, while lower values give warmer, yellow light.

                  This tool also functions as a temperature unit converter, allowing for quick and accurate conversions between Celsius and Kelvin. It's designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that anyone can easily convert temperatures without needing to perform manual calculations.

                <p class="paragraph">
                  Understanding temperature conversions is essential in many fields, including science, cooking, and travel. This calculator provides a reliable way to switch between temperature scales, making it a useful tool for both personal and professional use.
