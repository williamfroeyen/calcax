                    To convert from Fahrenheit to Kelvin, first subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit degrees. Then, divide the result by 1.8. This gives you the temperature in Celsius. Finally, add 273.15 to get the number of degrees in Kelvin. The formula is: °K = ((°F - 32) / 1.8) + 273.15.

                    Celsius is a temperature scale used across much of the world to measure temperature in degrees. The scale was developed by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius in 1742. It is based on the freezing point of water at 0 degrees and the boiling point at 100 degrees under normal atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere).
                    This makes it easy to understand and apply in scientific, industrial, and everyday contexts. The Celsius scale is used in most countries, except for the United States, where the Fahrenheit scale is still dominant.
                    In daily life, Celsius is used to measure temperatures for weather forecasts, cooking, heating, and cooling. For example, a normal indoor temperature is often between 20 and 22 degrees Celsius, while water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.

                    Anders Celsius was a renowned scientist who taught at Uppsala University in Sweden. Originally, he proposed a scale where 100 degrees was the freezing point of water and 0 degrees was the boiling point, opposite to what we use today. After his death, the scale was reversed by Carl Linnaeus or other scientists, making it more intuitive – lower temperatures got lower numerical values and higher temperatures got higher numerical values.

                  This tool also functions as a temperature unit converter, allowing for quick and accurate conversions between Fahrenheit and Kelvin. It's designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that anyone can easily convert temperatures without needing to perform manual calculations.

                  Understanding temperature conversions is essential in many fields, including science, cooking, and travel. This calculator provides a reliable way to switch between temperature scales, making it a useful tool for both personal and professional use.
