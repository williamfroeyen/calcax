                    To convert kilograms to stones, multiply the number of kilograms by 0.157473044. The formula is: Stones = kg * 0.157473044. A "stone" is a traditional British unit of weight still used in some English-speaking countries, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. One stone is exactly equal to 14 pounds or approximately 6.35029 kilograms. Although the metric system is standard in most countries, stones still hold cultural and practical significance in certain contexts.

                    Historically, the use of stones as a weight measure has its roots in the Middle Ages. The word "stone" comes from the Old English "stān," meaning rock, which makes sense as physical stones were often used as standard weights in early trade agreements. The weight of a stone could vary depending on the region and type of goods. For example, a stone of wool might have a different weight than a stone of grain.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Today, stones are mainly used to express body weight. In the UK, it is common to hear someone say they weigh "11 stone 4 pounds," which is approximately 72.1 kg. This system is often considered more intuitive for many Britons than using only kilograms or pounds, as it provides a more precise and easily understandable breakdown of weight.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Despite its prevalence in British culture, the use of stones is limited in official contexts. In sports, especially boxing and rugby, weight is often given in stones, but in medical and scientific contexts, the metric system is used. EU directives have also led to increased use of kilograms in the UK, especially on goods sold in stores.
