                    To convert ounces to grams, multiply the number of ounces by 28.3495231. The formula is: Grams = ounces * 28.3495231. The gram is a unit of mass measurement in the metric system. The symbol for gram is "g," and it is a base unit often used in everyday life to weigh small amounts of various substances, such as foods, medicines, and chemical compounds. One gram is equivalent to one-thousandth of a kilogram, which is the base SI unit for mass.

                    Historically, the gram was defined as the mass of one cubic centimeter (1 cm³) of pure water at a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius, which is the temperature at which water has its highest density. Later, the definition was linked to the international prototype of the kilogram, a cylindrical block of platinum-iridium stored in France. In more recent times, the definition of the kilogram, and thus the gram, has been based on physical constants such as Planck's constant to ensure greater precision.

                    Grams are used in many contexts. In cooking, it is common to specify ingredients in grams to ensure accurate measurements, especially in baking where the ratios between ingredients are crucial. In medical contexts, it is important to dose medications accurately in grams or milligrams to ensure patient safety. In science and laboratory work, the gram is a standard unit for measuring chemical substances with high precision.
